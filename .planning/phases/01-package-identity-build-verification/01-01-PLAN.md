    - rn-cli.config.js (DELETE)
    - .gitignore
  </files>
  <action>
Delete rn-cli.config.js:
- This is a React Native CLI config file that is no longer needed for a web-only package
- Run: rm rn-cli.config.js

Update .gitignore:
- Add "coverage/" to the gitignore to prevent test coverage folder from being committed
- The coverage folder contains absolute paths that change per machine

Verify no react-native in source:
- Run: grep -r "react-native" src/
- Expected: No matches (src/ is already clean from v4.0 migration)

Verify no react-native dependencies in package.json:
- Run: cat package.json | grep -i "react-native"
- Expected: No matches

Verify build works:
- Run: npm run build
- Check dist/ contains: index.js (ESM), index.cjs (CJS), index.d.ts, index.d.cts

Verify tests pass:
- Run: npm run test
- Expected: 24 tests passing
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `ls rn-cli.config.js 2>&1`
Expected: "No such file or directory"

Run: `grep "coverage" .gitignore`
Expected: "coverage/" appears in output

Run: `grep -r "react-native" src/`
Expected: No output (no matches)

Run: `npm run build && ls dist/`
Expected: index.cjs, index.d.cts, index.d.ts, index.js, index.js.map, index.cjs.map

Run: `npm run test`
Expected: "24 passed" or similar success message
  </verify>
  <done>
- rn-cli.config.js deleted
- coverage/ added to .gitignore
- No react-native references in src/ or package.json
- Build produces ESM, CJS, and TypeScript declarations
- All 24 tests pass
  </done>

1. Package identity: `cat package.json | grep -E '"name"|"version"'` shows simple-body-highlighter-react and 1.0.0
2. No old references: `grep -r "react-body-highlighter" . --include="*.md" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.json" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .planning` returns no matches
3. No react-native: `grep -r "react-native" src/` and `grep "react-native" package.json` both return no matches
4. rn-cli.config.js removed: `ls rn-cli.config.js` fails
5. Build works: `npm run build` succeeds and `ls dist/` shows all expected files
6. Tests pass: `npm run test` shows 24 passing tests
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. `npm run build` completes without errors and produces dist/ with ESM and CJS bundles
2. `npm run test` passes all 24 tests with no failures
3. package.json shows name as "simple-body-highlighter-react" and version as "1.0.0"
4. `grep -r "react-native" src/` returns no matches
5. rn-cli.config.js no longer exists
6. All documentation shows new package name
</success_criteria>
